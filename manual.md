# some manual steps to finish setting up the machine

some things aren't worth automating beyond a certain point:

## karabiner
the first time you run `rc brew`, you'll be prompted for password to install karabiner
then, launch karabiner and follow the prompts to setup macos permissions for accessibility control and to install the virtual keyboard device

## hammerspoon
on first run, follow the prompts to setup macos permissions for accessibility control

## bartender
get it from https://www.macbartender.com/ then run the init in the bartender submodule
